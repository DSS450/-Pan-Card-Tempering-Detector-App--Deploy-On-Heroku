# -Pan-Card-Tempering-Detector-App--Deploy-On-Heroku
Purpose:
The primary goal of the PAN Card Tampering Detector App is to provide a quick and efficient way to identify if a digital image of a PAN card has been altered or forged. This is crucial for various applications, including KYC (Know Your Customer) processes, financial transactions, and identity verification, where the integrity of identification documents is paramount.

Key Features (Conceptual for a full app):

Image Upload: Users can easily upload an image of a PAN card (e.g., JPEG, PNG) through a user-friendly interface.

Tampering Detection Algorithm:

Metadata Analysis: Check for inconsistencies in image metadata that might indicate editing.

Pixel-Level Analysis: Examine pixel patterns, noise levels, and compression artifacts to identify areas that have been digitally manipulated.

Feature Extraction: Extract key features from the PAN card (e.g., text, photo, hologram, signature area) and compare them against known templates or reference data.

Forensic Analysis: Look for signs of copy-pasting, cloning, blurring, or other common tampering techniques.

AI/ML Integration: Utilize machine learning models trained on vast datasets of genuine and tampered PAN card images to predict the likelihood of tampering.

Result Display:

Clearly indicate whether the uploaded PAN card image is likely "Genuine" or "Tampered."
